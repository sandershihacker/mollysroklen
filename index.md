# About Me

Hi! I am **Molly Roklen**, a ideator, connector, and aspiring **entrepreneur**.

My drive for continuous learning and passion for creativity
has spurred my decision to move to Israel (the ‘Start-Up Nation’)
to earn a **Global MBA** with a concentration in Entrepreneurship and
Innovation. My expected graduation date from **Tel Aviv University** is August 2021.

Feel free to connect and reach out!
